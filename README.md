# PlantCare-AI-Advanced-Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Transfer-Learning
PlantCare AI uses transfer learning with MobileNetV2 to classify plant diseases from 87,000+ leaf images across 38 classes in the New Plant Diseases Dataset. It delivers accurate, efficient, and scalable disease detection for crops like apple, corn, grape, potato, and tomato, aiding farmers and gardeners.
PlantCare AI aims to develop an accurate and efficient model for classifying plant diseases by employing transfer learning techniques. Utilizing the New Plant Diseases Dataset containing over 87,000 annotated plant leaf images categorized into 38 distinct classes including various diseases affecting crops like Apple, Corn, Grape, Potato, Tomato, and others, the project leverages the pre-trained MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network (CNN) to expedite training and improve classification accuracy. Transfer learning allows the model to benefit from pre-existing knowledge of image features, significantly enhancing its performance and reducing computational costs. This approach provides a reliable and scalable tool for farmers, agricultural professionals, and gardeners, ensuring precise and efficient plant disease identification.
